            JavaScript is a scripting language used to create and control
            dynamic website content i.e. anything that moves, refreshes, or
            otherwise changes on your screen without requiring you to manually
            reload a web page. Features like:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>animated graphics</li>
            <li>photo slideshows</li>
            <li>autocomplete text suggestions</li>
            <li>interactive forms</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            An even better way of understanding what JavaScript does is to think
            about certain web features you use every day and likely take for
            granted—like when your Facebook timeline automatically updates on
            your screen or Google suggests search terms based on a few letters
            you’ve started typing. In both cases, that’s JavaScript in action.

            If you’re hoping to break into a career in tech, your question might
            sound more like: “<em>What is JavaScript and do I need it?</em> ”
          </p>
          <p>
            If you’re interested in web development—the answer is a resounding
            yes. So with that out of the way, let’s go a bit deeper into how
            JavaScript works.
          </p>

          <h3>The Power of 3: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</h3>

          <p>
            When most people learn to code, they start with good old HTML and
            CSS. From there, they move on to JavaScript. Which makes sense! The
            three elements together form the backbone of web development.
          </p>
          <p>For those not familiar:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>HTML</strong> is the structure of your page—the headers,
              the body text, any images you want to include
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>CSS</strong> controls how that page looks (it’s what
              you’ll use to customize fonts, background colors, etc.)
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>JavaScript</strong> is the magic third element. Once
              you’ve created your structure (HTML) and your aesthetic vibe
              (CSS), JavaScript makes your site or project dynamic.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>JavaScript is Used to Automate and Animate</h3>

          <p>
            I mentioned above that JavaScript is a
            <em>“Scripting language.”</em> Scripting languages are coding
            languages used to automate processes that users would otherwise need
            to execute on their own, step-by-step. Short of scripting, any
            changes on web pages you visit would require either manually
            reloading the page, or navigating a series of static menus to get to
            the content you’re after
          </p>
          <p>
            A scripting language like JavaScript (JS, for those in the know)
            does the heavy lifting by telling computer programs like websites or
            web applications to <em>“do something.”</em> In the case of
            JavaScript, this means telling those dynamic features described
            earlier to do whatever it is they do—like telling images to animate
            themselves, photos to cycle through a slideshow, or autocomplete
            suggestions to respond to prompts. It’s the <em>“script”</em> in
            JavaScript that makes these things happen seemingly on their own.
          </p>

          <p>
            Meanwhile, because JavaScript is such an integral part of web
            functionality, all major web browsers come with built-in engines
            that can render JavaScript. This means JS commands can be typed
            directly into an HTML document, and web browsers will be able to
            understand them. In other words, using JavaScript doesn’t require
            downloading any additional programs or compilers.

        <article>
          <p>
            We covered this a bit in the intro, but here’s a quick list of the
            main things JavaScript is used for.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong> Adding interactivity to websites—yup</strong>, if you
              want a website to be more than a static page of text, you’ll need
              to do some JavaScripting
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Developing mobile applications</strong>—JavaScript isn’t
              just for websites…it’s used to create those apps you have on your
              phone and tablet as well
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Creating web browser based games</strong>—Ever played a
              game directly from your web browser? JavaScript probably helped
              make that happen
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Back end web development</strong>—yeah, JavaScript is
              MOSTLY used on the front end of things, but it’s a versatile
              enough scripting language to be used on back end infrastructure,
              too.
            </li>
          </ul>

      </section>

      <section class="main-section" id="How_Does_JavaScript_Work?">
        <header>How Does JavaScript Work?</header>
        <article>
          <p>
            JavaScript is either embedded into a web page or else it’s included
            in a .js file. JavaScript is also a <em>“client-side”</em> language
            (rather than a <em>“server-side”</em> language), which is a fancy
            way of saying that it gets downloaded to site visitors’ computers,
            then processed.
          </p>

          <h3>How Do You Add JavaScript to a Website?</h3>
          <p>
            Actually adding JavaScript code to a web page is a pretty simple
            process (and a familiar one if you’ve done any coding with HTML and
            CSS). JavaScript can be added directly to a page’s code using using
            <code> &lt;script&gt;</code> tags and giving them the type attribute
            text/javascript. Honestly, JavaScript looks very similar to adding
            CSS to a site. Here’s a side-by-side comparison:
          </p>
          <code><strong>CSS:</strong></code>
          <code> &lt;style&gt; CSS goes here &lt;/style&gt; </code>
          <code><strong>JavaScript:</strong></code>

          <code
            >&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt; JavaScript code goes here
            &lt;/script&gt;</code
          >

          <p>
            Voila! JavaScript code can also be added to a page as a separate
            header file with the extension .js (generally done if it’s code that
            you want to include across a number of pages at once). The script is
            then downloaded and processed in each individual’s web browser,
            turning it into the dynamic objects and effects they see on their
            screen.
          </p>
          <p>
            One word of warning, though: since JavaScript is processed by
            individual browsers, it’s possible a user might have JavaScript
            disabled on their end. Sites that use JavaScript need to have a back
            up plan in place to avoid breaking when this happens.
          </p>

      <section class="main-section" id="What_is_Vanilla_JavaScript?">
        <header>What is Vanilla JavaScript?</header>
        <article>
          <p>
            As you dig into JavaScript you’ll eventually hear the term
            <em>“vanilla Javascript.”</em> So what does that mean?
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Vanilla JavaScript</strong> is the JavaScript language
            <em>“as is”</em> without using any tools to make the coding process
            easier or more efficient.
          </p>

          <p>
            To give you an idea of what vanilla JavaScript looks like, consider
            the following basic example of JavaScript code. If you wanted users
            to receive a <em>“thanks for signing up”</em> confirmation message
            after signing up for an offer or service on a website, you would
            code it directly into an HTML page (between &lt;script&gt; tags)
            like this:
          </p>
          <code style="font-weight: 400">&lt;script&gt;</code>
          <code style="font-weight: 400">window.onload = initAll;</code>
          <code style="font-weight: 400">function initAll() {</code>
          <code style="font-weight: 400">
            >document.getElementById(“submit”).onclick = submitMessage;</code
          >
          <code style="font-weight: 400">}</code>
          <code style="font-weight: 400">function submitMessage() {</code>
          <code style="font-weight: 400">
            >var greeting =
            document.getElementById(“name”).getAttribute(“value”);</code
          >
          <code style="font-weight: 400"
            >document.getElementById(“headline”).innerHTML = “Thank you for
            joining our email
          </code>
          <code style="font-weight: 400">list,” + greeting;</code>
          <code style="font-weight: 400">return false;</code>
          <code style="font-weight: 400">}</code>
          <code style="font-weight: 400">&lt;script&gt</code>

          <p>
            Vanilla JS like this can be used to create JavaScript projects, but
            as you become more familiar with the JavaScript language, there are
            different tools you can implement to make JS easier and more
            efficient to use.

          Advanced Javascript: Frameworks and Libraries (AKA Tools to Make JS
          Easier)
        </header>
        <article>
          <p>
            As you might imagine, using vanilla javascript alone takes…forever
            and for web developers, and time is money. That’s why JavaScript
            frameworks and libraries (tools that make JS a whooole lot easier to
            use) are your new best friends. Here’s a breakdown of some of the
            main ones you’ll encounter and what they do.
          </p>
          <h3>JQuery—The O.G. JavaScript Library</h3>
          <p>
            When you work with JavaScript, you’ll notice JS functions and
            features that show up regularly across multiple websites or web
            apps—things like menu animations and fade outs, file upload forms,
            and image galleries. While you could code each of these things from
            the ground up every time you need one, your coding life will feel a
            lot easier if you use coding libraries like jQuery instead.
          </p>
          <p>
            The jQuery library is made up of JavaScript coding functions that
            can be performed through single line jQuery commands. For example,
            the JavaScript code example above looks like this if it’s performed
            using jQuery code instead:
          </p>

          <code style="font-weight: 400">&lt;script&gt;</code>
          <code style="font-weight: 400">$(“#submit”).click(function () {</code>
          <code style="font-weight: 400">var greeting = $(“#name”).val();</code>
          <code style="font-weight: 400"
            >$(“#headline”).html(“Thank you for joining our email list, ” +
            greeting);</code
          >
          <code style="font-weight: 400">return false;</code>
          <code style="font-weight: 400">});</code>
          <code style="font-weight: 400">&lt;script/&gt; </code>
          <p>
            As you can see, the jQuery programming approach is a lot more
            concise, and it can be reused any time you want to perform the same
            JavaScript function while coding a website or web app.
          </p>
          <p>
            In addition to examples like the one above (which are considered
            jQuery snippets—snippets of code inserted directly from the jQuery
            library to perform dedicated functions), jQuery code can be put
            together to create more complicated plugins. jQuery plugins can be
            found directly from the jQuery UI (User Interface) repository, where
            source code is available for copying and pasting.
          </p>

          <h3>React JS—A Front End Developer’s Best Friend</h3>
          <p>
            Along with jQuery, React JS is another key JavaScript library for
            web developers. React JS is a front end JavaScript library developed
            by Facebook in 2011 and designed specifically for building UIs (user
            interfaces). If you’re not familiar, UIs are the collection of
            on-screen menus, search bars, buttons, and anything else someone
            interacts with to use a website or app, and while you CAN build them
            painstakingly by hand with vanilla JavaScript, who has time for
            that?
          </p>
          <p>
            React allows developers to use prewritten code for repetitive menu
            objects and effects (like interactive forms, autocomplete features,
            fade-in or out menu animations, etc.), and it also improves overall
            site speed and performance through feature called Virtual DOM (which
            you can read all about here). Learning how to use React JS will make
            your life a whole lot easier as a JavaScript developer, and it will
            also make you a lot more hireable.
          </p>

          <h3>Other JavaScript Libraries and Frameworks</h3>

          <p>
            While JS libraries like jQuery and React function as digital Swiss
            Army knives for individual coding needs, front-end developers can
            take things a step farther by using tools called JavaScript
            frameworks.
          </p>
          <p>
            Extending past the patchwork functionality of jQuery, JS frameworks
            provide JavaScript developers with full templates for websites or
            web applications. JS frameworks then create spaces in those
            templates where JS code is recommended to go, as well as prewritten
            code (much like jQuery) that can be plugged into those spaces.
          </p>

            The takeaway here? While HTML and CSS are the skills that will let
            you code a basic web page, JavaScript is the programming language
            that will bring that page to life. Even though HTML and CSS by
            themselves will put you in position to do beginning developer work,
            taking the time to learn JavaScript will help your job prospects
            increase exponentially.
